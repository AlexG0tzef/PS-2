<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "lclk.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "lclk.v". The design "lclk.v" is a 12 bit down counter. The counter has a synchronous set signal, that sets the counter to 1745. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The output port cout will be asserted at the completion of count sequence. The ports cin and cout are used to chain multiple counters together. </P>
