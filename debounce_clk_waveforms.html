<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file "debounce_clk.v" </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of lpm_counter megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design "debounce_clk.v". The design "debounce_clk.v" is a 8 bit down counter. The counter has a synchronous set signal, that sets the counter to 130. </P>

<P><FONT size=3>The output port cout will be asserted at the completion of count sequence. The ports cin and cout are used to chain multiple counters together. </P>
